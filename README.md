 # Model Used:

XG-Boost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a gradient boosting library in python. It is based on gradient boosted decision trees. It is a boosting algorithm which is used in various competitions like Kaggle for improving the model accuracy and robustness. Decision tree-based algorithms are considered best for small/medium structured or tabular data. Building models using XG-Boost is quite easy. But improving its efficiency is really hard. We have various parameters in XG-Boost, which requires tuning.
